				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
				<ul class="accordion_gray">
					<li class="accordion_item">
						<a class="accordion_header">What is the Design Thinking Process, and why is this crucial in a discovery workshop?</a>
						<div class="accordion_content"><p>Essentially, Design Thinking helps the AI development team shift their focus from "what technology is possible" to "how can technology best serve the user." This results in custom artificial intelligence solutions that are more user-centric, impactful, and less likely to fail.<br><br>To assist our clients in a smooth AI transformation journey, the Design Thinking Process is a human-centered methodology we use to approach complex challenges and develop solutions creatively. It is particularly valuable in our discovery workshops, as it focuses on user needs, uncovers untapped opportunities, reduces the risk of project failure, and promotes iterative development that allows continuous improvement.<br><br>Read more about our AI workshop service.</p></div>
					</li>
					<li class="accordion_item">
						<a class="accordion_header">We want to introduce AI into our business processes, but we are completely new. How can we know if the solution will work for us?</a>
						<div class="accordion_content"><p>Don't overwhelm yourself by attempting to automate everything at once. Instead, start small and start smart—choose to begin with a focused pilot project, also known as a proof of concept (PoC). PoC is a great way to showcase how solutions work, assess their value, and gain practical experience with AI development before scaling up.<br><br>If you are a startup, a PoC empowers you to navigate the unknown with AI by mitigating risks, attracting investment, and refining your solution for success.</p></div>
